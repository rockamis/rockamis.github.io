  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, there. My name is Rock LaManna, alias Rockamis, and I'm a writer/editor running this blog as a portfolio and means to publish my thoughts about my hobby of game design for tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs).</p>
  <p>Professionally, I have 10 years of editorial experience gained creating and proofreading closed captions, reviewing fiction for the Twin Cities literary magazine <i>Whistling Shade</i>, and managing production editorial in education publishing. If you'd like to know more about experience, head over to my CV page. Writing samples can be found in the Rogue Atlas section of this blog, and I'll add highlights here once I've published enough to have some.</p>
  <p>In the hobby space, I have been playing TTRPGs for over 15 years, and I have been running games for almost just as long. I come from a traditional playstyle background but have come to enjoy the DIY design culture, problem-solving playstyle, and rules-lite systems of the OSR/NSR. Starting this blog is a means for me to get involved in that design culture and share my thoughts. My primary focus is on campaign design for fantasy sandboxes.</p>
